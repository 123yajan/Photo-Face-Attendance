# Face Recognition Matching Assignment

This project utilizes a Python face-recognition library to match a reference image with a set of different images. The dataset comprises 10 different sets of images.

## Overview

In this assignment, we aim to demonstrate the use of face-recognition techniques to identify and match a reference image from a collection of images. The dataset contains 10 distinct sets of images for testing and validation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes 10 different sets of images. Each set contains multiple images that will be used to find a match with the given reference image.

## Objectives

- Implement face-recognition using Python.
- Match a reference image with images from the dataset.

## Dependencies

- Python
- face-recognition library

## Installation

To get started, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install face-recognition
